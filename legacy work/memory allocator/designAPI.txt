first_fit: This was a function that I used to implement the first_fit algorithm for allocation. It is one of the options that that be selected to
by changing the "policy" value in allocate and returns a void* to the allocated memory's data value (acting as address).

best_fit: This was a function that I used to implement the best_fit algorithm for allocation. It is one of the options that that be selected to
by changing the "policy" value in allocate and returns a void* to the allocated memory's data value (acting as address).

worst_fit: This was a function that I used to implement the worst_fit algorithm for allocation. It is one of the options that that be selected to
by changing the "policy" value in allocate and returns a void* to the allocated memory's data value (acting as address).

dlist_find_memory: This is a function that I wrote in order to pull out the size_t memory value of a specific memory block. I used this when adding back memory to the free list in 
deallocate.

dlist_find_memory_reduce: This is a function that goes into a dlist and subtracts a specific memory block's memory value by some given size_t value. I used this in best_fit and worst_fit
respetively in order to mimic taking away memory from a continous block.

memory_test_2.c: This was a more stripped down file I wrote for testing my allocator.
